I am Hardik Gupta and I'm currently a student at NIT Hamirpur studying Electronics and Communication Engineering.

My interests are digital art and photography.

I always try to give my best to the task at hand and try to work harder.

I am also a volunteer at the Robotics society of NIT Hamirpur.

I have worked on a Quadruped Bot which is a 4 legged bot that uses 12 servos for it's movement. It has a 3D 
printed anatomy. It has object detection, motion tracking and face recognition capabilities.
